Common tips for FAST leveling:
- Try to no TP to Town at all (saves time and scrolls).
--- this guide will tell you when it is really needed
- Each time you're in town, take rewards and check what vendors sells
- While in Act1, look vendors for boots with + speed
--- type "nn" in filter to find them
--- in Act 2 if still don't have them, just bench craft it
- Always make spells "attack without moving"
- Try to be 1-3 lvl below the zone level
--- do not try to kill all mobs in a zone
- Untill ~Blood Aqueduct (Act 8) don't pay attention to drops from mobs
--- except rings/currency/items with needed links
--- keep in mind which links/currency you will need later
- Prepare a lootfilter for you!
--- https://www.filterblade.xyz/ is a nice place for that
- Don't use chest armor, chest armor slow your movement speed
- Wait until level ~10-12 for league mechanics
- It is worth killing blue mobs groups early, but not rare mobs
- Pick up all small blues to vendor for alteration shards
