This leveling guide was made based on Asmodeus TR/CA Pathfinder guide.
Asmodeus video guide is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuY3ifzuIsE&t=806s&ab_channel=AsmodeusClips.

Important!
This guide is focused on help with blasting through acts as fast as possible.
When you've killed A10 Kitava -> guide is done. It doesn't have potential 6-links setups, skills for red maps etc.
Please spend some time then and choose a final build for your character. There is a lot of them on forum/youtube.
